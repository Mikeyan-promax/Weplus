Deduction Rules
The expense = number of tokens × price. The corresponding fees will be directly deducted from your topped-up balance or granted balance, with a preference for using the granted balance first when both balances are available.

Product prices may vary and DeepSeek reserves the right to adjust them. We recommend topping up based on your actual usage and regularly checking this page for the most recent pricing information.

Rate Limit
DeepSeek API does NOT constrain user's rate limit. We will try out best to serve every request.

However, please note that when our servers are under high traffic pressure, your requests may take some time to receive a response from the server. During this period, your HTTP request will remain connected, and you may continuously receive contents in the following formats:

Non-streaming requests: Continuously return empty lines
Streaming requests: Continuously return SSE keep-alive comments (: keep-alive)
These contents do not affect the parsing of the JSON body by the OpenAI SDK. If you are parsing the HTTP responses yourself, please ensure to handle these empty lines or comments appropriately.

If the request is still not completed after 30 minutes, the server will close the connection.
